# NoitaWikiScraper

Little node project to give me an excuse to play with javascript since it's about as frustrating and magical as [Noita](https://noitagame.com/), ["A totally finnished and bug free game."](https://noitagame.com/release_notes/).

This is currently built to only scrape the [Noita Wiki Spell Information Table](https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_Information_Table) and the sub pages the spells are linked to under `/wiki/<spell>`, such as [Energy Orb](https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Orb)

## Dependencies

```
npm install cheerio, request-promise
```

## Execution

Just call `index.js`

```
node .\index.js
```
